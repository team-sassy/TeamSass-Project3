# TeamSass-Project3

## Overview
Traveling should be fun, no headache and easy to navigate. Most current traveling sites can be used to book flights, hotels or finding locations to visit. There currently is not one website that can help you to perform all these functions. Our travel organizer will aim to facilitate you to find your tickets to your dream destination (either through car book or flight booking), help you to book your hotel/accommodation for your trip, finding must-see-places for your travel… all of these can be easily organized into a travel log book which allows you to schedule/organize your travel at your utmost convenience
